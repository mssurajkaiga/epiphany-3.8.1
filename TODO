Some TODO items, in no particular order:

- Use g_clear_object in dispose/finalize
- Get rid of object references in dispose, not finalize
- Move all the old code to the new coding style 
- embed/ does not make much sense anymore as a name. Rename to
  something else, perhaps core/? webview/?
- Use GtkBuilder instead of declaring the UIs with C
- We practically don't test any part of Epiphany, change that (how do
  you test UI code? There's like 3 or 4 frameworks for this, pick one?
  What does Chrome do?)
- Do we want extensions that can mess with the internals? Or only
  jetpack-like stuff
- Come up with a C migration plan

Old (double check they still apply):

- Port to new gtk+ uri-list DND APIs
- Use GtkNotebook DnD
